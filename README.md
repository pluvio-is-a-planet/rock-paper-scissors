# rock-paper-scissors

In this project I will be creating a simple rock paper scissors game,
that will be played from the browser console. I will be using
everything that I have learnt in javascript so far.

Things I've learned while completing this project:
 - Declaring an array and using it's values
 - Using the Math.random and Math.floor functions to select a random item from an array
 - How a for loop works and how to control it's iterator variable
 - How to receive input from the user and assign it to a variable
 - How to use functions within functions
 - How to compare two values to check for the correct value
 - How to return an object and access it's properties outside of it's function's scope

Overall this was a very fun project to complete, and I feel like it's a
fairly good baseline for testing your skills in javascript when you
have just started learning.
